# STM32 Crash Reporter

This library implements a basic crash reporter for Cortex-M3 and Cortex-M4 based STM32 microcontrollers.
It's aim is to be small and helpful for debugging runtime issues on-chip.

The library is not intended for use with some on-chip RTOS and will likely need some modifications
to work correctly in such environments.
